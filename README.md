Remove entries in the Windows Remote Desktop Connection client


After you use the Remote Desktop Connection tool to connect to another computer, the name of the computer is added to the Remote Desktop Connection Computer box. It's easy for you to quickly select the same computer at a later time. However, the tool doesn't provide a way to clear the list of computers or remove one or more entries from the Computer box.


With this script you can simply remove RDP entries from your computer.
